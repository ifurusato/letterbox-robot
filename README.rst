*****************************************************************************
Letterbox-Robot: The operating system for a robot that resides in a letterbox
*****************************************************************************

This provides a *Robot Operating System* (ROS) for a Raspberry Pi based robot
written in Python 3, whose prototype hardware implementations is a fixed-location
robot that resides in a letterbox.

The hardware consists of a PIR sensor and an HT0740 Switch controlling a 12v
power supply to toggle a 2.5 meter strip of white LEDs, to light the garden path.

It also has a Pi camera that looks down from the ceiling to view what's in the
mailbox and provides a live video stream, with both daylight and night settings.

This currently runs as a simple daemon process but at some point will use the 
KROS Core robot operating system, a Python3-based Subsumption Architecture, 
basically a publish-subscribe pattern implemented using an asyncio message bus,
where the robot sensors are publishers, motor controllers and other output 
devices, etc. act as subscribers. Subscribers indicate what event types they're 
interested in. Events are pushed onto the message bus, passed through an 
Arbitrator and on to a Controller. The Controller for the LBR01 will control
both the camera and the LED light strip.

and the NZPRG wiki at:

* `LBR01 Robot <https://service.robots.org.nz/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=LBR01>`

This project is part of the *New Zealand Personal Robotics (NZPRG)* "Robot
Operating System" â€” not to be confused with other "ROS" projects. 


Features
********

* `Behaviour-Based System (BBS) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-based_robotics>`
* `Subsumption Architecture <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsumption_architecture>` [#f1]_
* Configuration via YAML file
* written in Python 3

.. [#f1] Uses finite state machines, an asynchronous message queue, an arbitrator and controller for task prioritisation.


Status
******

This project should currently be considered a "**Technology Preview**".

The project is still in an early prototyping stage.

The project is being exposed publicly so that those interested can follow its
progress. At such a time when the ROS is generally useable this status section
will be updated accordingly.


Installation
************

The project requires installation of a number of support libraries. In order to
begin you'll need Python3 (at least 3.8) and pip3.

You'll need the colorama, pyyaml, python-daemon, RPi.GPIO, and ht0740 libraries.

The setup.py script performs a standard library installation. You can also use::

    sudo pip3 install -e .


Support & Liability
*******************

This project comes with no promise of support or liability. Use at your own risk.


Further Information
*******************

For more information check out the `NZPRG Blog <https://robots.org.nz/>` and
`NZPRG Wiki <https://service.robots.org.nz/wiki/>`.

Please note that the documentation in the code will likely be more current
than this README file, so please consult it for the "canonical" information.


Execution
*********

To force the Raspberry Pi to prioritise execution of the python operating
system, use the 'chrt' command, e.g.::

    % chrt -f 5 python3 ./fusion_test.py
