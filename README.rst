*****************************************************************************
Letterbox-Robot: The operating system for a robot that resides in a letterbox
*****************************************************************************

This provides a *Robot Operating System* (ROS) for a Raspberry Pi based robot
written in Python 3, whose prototype hardware implementations is a fixed-location
robot that resides in a letterbox.

The hardware consists of a PIR sensor and an HT0740 Switch controlling a 12v
power supply to toggle a 2.5 meter strip of white LEDs, to light the garden path.

and the NZPRG wiki at:

* `LBR01 Robot <https://service.robots.org.nz/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=LBR01>`

This project is part of the *New Zealand Personal Robotics (NZPRG)* "Robot
Operating System" â€” not to be confused with other "ROS" projects. 


Features
********

* `Behaviour-Based System (BBS) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-based_robotics>`
* `Subsumption Architecture <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsumption_architecture>` [#f1]_
* Configuration via YAML file
* written in Python 3

.. [#f1] Uses finite state machines, an asynchronous message queue, an arbitrator and controller for task prioritisation.


Status
******

This project should currently be considered a "**Technology Preview**".

The project is still in an early prototyping stage.

The project is being exposed publicly so that those interested can follow its
progress. At such a time when the ROS is generally useable this status section
will be updated accordingly.


Installation
************

The project requires installation of a number of support libraries. In order to
begin you'll need Python3 (at least 3.8) and pip3.

The setup.py script performs a standard library installation. You can also use::

    sudo pip3 install -e .


Support & Liability
*******************

This project comes with no promise of support or liability. Use at your own risk.


Further Information
*******************

For more information check out the `NZPRG Blog <https://robots.org.nz/>` and
`NZPRG Wiki <https://service.robots.org.nz/wiki/>`.

Please note that the documentation in the code will likely be more current
than this README file, so please consult it for the "canonical" information.


Execution
*********

To force the Raspberry Pi to prioritise execution of the python operating
system, use the 'chrt' command, e.g.::

    % chrt -f 5 python3 ./fusion_test.py
